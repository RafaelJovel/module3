### Notes
[Additional context, background information, or technical considerations]

## Acceptance Criteria (Tasks)

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be completed SEQUENTIALLY. Only ONE task can be "🔵 IN PROGRESS" at a time.

### Task 1: [Task Name]
**Given** [context/precondition]  
**When** [action/trigger]  
**Then** [expected behavior/outcome]

**Status**: ⚪ TODO / 🔵 IN PROGRESS / ✅ COMPLETE

### Task 2: [Task Name]
**Given** [context/precondition]  
**When** [action/trigger]  
**Then** [expected behavior/outcome]

**Status**: ⚪ TODO

### Task 3: [Task Name]
**Given** [context/precondition]  
**When** [action/trigger]  
**Then** [expected behavior/outcome]

**Status**: ⚪ TODO

## Current Task: Task N - [Task Name]

### Current Stage: 🔵 [PLAN / BUILD & ASSESS / REFLECT & ADAPT / COMMIT & PICK NEXT]

⚠️ **SEQUENTIAL TASK REMINDER**: Before implementing, verify:
- [ ] Is this the ONLY task marked "🔵 IN PROGRESS"?
- [ ] Have ALL previous tasks been marked "✅ COMPLETE"?
- [ ] Am I implementing ONLY this task's Given-When-Then scenario?

## PLAN Stage Details

### Test Strategy

#### Unit Tests (with mocked dependencies)
1. **[Component/Module] Tests**
   - `Test_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior`
   - `Test_Scenario_EdgeCase`

#### Integration Tests (with real dependencies)
1. **[Integration Scenario] Tests**
   - `Integration_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior`

### File Changes Needed

**Files to Create:**
- `path/to/new-file.ext` - Description of purpose

**Files to Modify:**
- `path/to/existing-file.ext` - Description of changes

### Dependencies Required
